# Aether ROC Development

This repository contains a Makefile and scripts for conveniently bringing up the Aether ROC
in a local development environment based on [k3d](https://k3d.io/).  The Aether ROC uses
[onos-config](https://docs.onosproject.org/onos-config/docs/) to dynamically configure
and manage [Aether](https://opennetworking.org/aether/).

## Prerequisites

Install the following tools on your development machine:
* Docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
* k3d: https://k3d.io/#installation
* kubectl: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/
* Helm: https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

## Bootstrap

Before bringing up the ROC for the first time, it's necessary to run:

```bash
make bootstrap REPO_PASSWORD=<passwd>    # download the Aether ROC Helm charts and their dependencies
```

Replace `<passwd>` above with the actual password for the private SD-RAN Helm Charts repo.

## Bringing up the ROC

Here's a simple workflow for bringing up the ROC locally and populating some sample models:

```bash
make k3d-cluster-up       # bring up a single-node k3d cluster
make aether-up            # install the Aether ROC
make sdcore-adapter-topo  # connect onos-config to sdcore-adapter
make demo-post-2.0.0      # load some sample models into the ROC
```

At this point you should be able to see the models loaded into the ROC reflected
in the logs of the `sdcore-adapter` container.  Since the Aether SD-CORE is not
running in your local environment, there is nothing for the ROC to configure.
The JSON that would be passed to the SD-CORE in an Aether deployment is just
written to a file in the `sdcore-adapter` for inspection.

## Interacting with the ROC

Assuming you have deployed the k3d cluster as described above, the ROC and ONOS are
available on localhost:
* ROC GUI: http://localhost:31190/
* ONOS GUI: http://localhost:31180/
* ROC API: http://localhost:31190/aether-roc-api/

### Interacting with the API via Swagger UI

The Swagger UI provides an easy way of visualizing and interacting with APIs.
Below are steps to configure Swagger UI in the cloud to interact with your local ROC API:
* Go to https://editor.swagger.io
* Select **File > Import URL**, point it to the raw version of the [aether-roc-api OpenAPI3 spec](https://github.com/onosproject/aether-roc-api/tree/master/api) that you want to import
* Select **Insert > Add Servers**, add the ROC API URL: http://localhost:31190/aether-roc-api/
* Go to an API call and click **Try it out**
* If using the **aether-1.0.0** OpenAPI spec, for **Target** enter **spgw-1**

You can also cut and paste the **curl** commands generated by Swagger UI into a local terminal.
